# Car Sales Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview
This project involves the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides comprehensive insights into car sales data. The dashboard allows users to analyze various aspects of car sales, including sales trends, geographical distribution, sales performance by model, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Objectives
To visualize car sales data in an interactive and user-friendly manner.
To provide insights into sales trends over time.
To analyze sales performance across different regions.
To compare sales performance by car model and manufacturer.
To identify key factors influencing sales performance.

## Data Source
The car sales data used in this dashboard was sourced from [specify source, e.g., company database, publicly available dataset]. The dataset includes information on sales transactions, car models, manufacturers, sales regions, and sales dates.

## Key Features and Visualizations
### Sales Overview

- Total Sales: A card visualization showing the total number of cars sold.
- Total Revenue: A card visualization displaying the total revenue generated from car sales.
- Average Sale Price: A card visualization indicating the average sale price of cars.

### Sales Trends

- Sales Over Time: A line chart depicting monthly sales trends, helping to identify peak sales periods.
- Year-over-Year Comparison: A bar chart comparing sales figures across different years.

### Geographical Distribution

- Sales by Region: A map visualization showing sales distribution across different regions, with color coding to indicate sales volume.
- Top Performing Regions: A table listing the top regions by sales volume.

### Sales Performance by Model

- Sales by Model: A bar chart showing the number of units sold for each car model.
- Revenue by Model: A bar chart displaying revenue generated by each car model.
- Top Selling Models: A table listing the top-selling car models.

### Manufacturer Analysis

Customer Satisfaction: A gauge visualization indicating average customer satisfaction scores.
### Interactive Elements
Filters and Slicers: Users can filter data by date range, region, manufacturer, and car model to customize their view of the data.
Drill-Through and Drill-Down: Users can click on visual elements to drill through to more detailed reports or drill down into specific data points for deeper analysis.
Hover Tooltips: Additional information is available on hover, providing more context without cluttering the visualizations.

### Implementation Steps

##Data Collection and Cleaning

Gather data from the specified sources.
Clean and preprocess the data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Data Modeling
